# Uploads

## Introduction

Manifest comes with a **built-in storage system** to upload assets locally (default) or in a [S3 bucket](./s3-storage). You can use [file upload](#upload-a-file) to let your users update any kind of file, or [image upload](#upload-an-image) for image resizing.

A `public/storage` folder is automatically created when needed. Uploaded files and images will be renamed with a unique name and stored in a specific folder based on entity and property name, ending by a folder with the current month name to prevent having too many files in a single folder.

Example: _public/storage/project/contract/Nov24/8dab3936m1p54a66-contract.pdf_

:::warning

If you want to set this file as an item's property, you need to upload the file first and then add the new uploaded file path as the property value creating or updating a record.

:::

## Add a BASE_URL variable

Manifest stores absolute paths for convenience.

By default the base url is set to `http://localhost:${port}` but you can change it using the `BASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file to adapt to your own base URL.

Example: `BASE_URL=https://example.com`.

:::warning

Changing the `BASE_URL` will not change the path of images and files that are already stored but it will impact the new ones.

## Upload a file

A file should be related to a property with the [file property type](./entities.md#file).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sdk" label="JS SDK" default>
    ```js

    // Create a Blob, adapt this step to your use case.
    const file = new Blob(['Hello, this is a test file!'], {
      type: 'text/plain',
    })

    // Upload a file that will be used as a contract for an invoice.
    const file = await manifest.from('invoices').upload('contract', file)

    console.log(file)
    // Output: {"path":"http://localhost:1111/invoices/contract/Oct2024/8dabo9qm1q3swvu-my-contract.pdf"}


    // Then you can store the path in the database.
    const invoice = await manifest.from('invoices').create({
      name: 'Invoice ACME',
      contract: file.path
    })
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rest" label="REST API" default>
    ```http
    // Upload file.
    POST /api/upload/file
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data
    {
        file: (binary)
        entity: invoices
        property: contract
    }

    // Response.
    {
        "path":"http://localhost:1111/invoices/contract/Oct2024/8dabo9qm1q3swvu-my-contract.pdf"
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>

## Upload an image

An image should be related to a property with the [image property type](./entities.md#image). Manifest accepts **.PNG** and **.JPG** images only.

Each image uploaded will be optimized and resized into several sizes based on [the property parameters](./entities.md#property-params). By default it generates a _thumbnail_ of 80x80 and a _medium_ of 160x160

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sdk" label="JS SDK" default>
    ```js
    // Create a Blob from an image, adapt this step to your use case.
    const base64Image =
      'iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mP8/wcAAwAB/eb7jLwAAAAASUVORK5CYII='
    const imageBlob: Blob = base64ToBlob(base64Image, 'image/png')

    // Upload the image.
    const image = await manifest.from('cats').uploadImage('avatar', imageBlob)

    console.log(image)
    // Output: {
    // "medium": "http://localhost:1111/cats/avatar/Oct2024/8dabo9qm1q4n1nk-medium.jpg",
    // "thumbnail": "http://localhost:1111/cats/avatar/Oct2024/8dabo9qm1q4n1nk-thumbnail.jpg"
    // }

    // Then you can store the path in the database.
    const cat = await manifest.from('cats').create({
      name: 'Felix',
      image: image
    })
    ```

  <TabItem value="rest" label="REST API" default>

        property: avatar
